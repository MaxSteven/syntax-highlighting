Atelier Schemes
===============

For the construction of these colorschemes,  [Solarized colorscheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) stood as a model, and [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) was a building tool. Like in Solarized, the colorschemes come in a light – and in a dark background version. It’s really just variations on the same idea, but each with it’s own color-value relations, interdependent on each other and their base (background-)color.

## Forest 
Base color for Forest is orange, and the idea is to have brownish colors for the background, not unlike a colorscheme like [“Birds of Paradise”](http://joebergantine.com/projects/color-schemes/birds-of-paradise/), but a bit muddier on the browns, less red and more greyed out, like clay.

## Heath
