Prism colorschemes   
==================

Prism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It is written in javascript, and the colorschemes are CSS stylesheets; so highly customisable.

## Customising

Except for the six that come with Prism, this repo contains more colorschemes, colected (stolen) from elsewhere and further adapted (tweaked).
When possible, backlinks to their origin, and information about their creators are included.
