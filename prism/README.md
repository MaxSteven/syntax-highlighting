==================

Prism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It is written in javascript, and the colorschemes are CSS stylesheets; so highly customisable.

## Customising

Except for the six that come with Prism, this repo contains more colorschemes, colected (stolen) from elsewhere and further adapted (tweaked).
