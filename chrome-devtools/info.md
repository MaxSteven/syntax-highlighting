Chrome Devtools - colour theme
=============================

One can change the way Chrome Developer Tools look by having a custom CSS stylesheet, named `Custom.css`.
The path for the directory that contains the file:

```
Mac: "Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User StyleSheets/" 
Linux: "~/.config/chrome/Default/User StyleSheets/" 
Windows: "C:\Users\**Your username**\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\User StyleSheets\"
```
For tweaking the theme you can use DevTools itself to inspect Devtools (surreal!): 
* undock DevTools
* then hit Ctrl-Alt-i or Cmd+alt+i on Mac. 

## Solarized Light 

Solarized Light is a syntax highlighting color-theme, made by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/). It is well balanced, and thoroughly tested, and comes in two varieties: a dark, or a light background. 

For this Chrome-DevTools colour-theme the light background-colour variety was the starting point. In a few places the dark background give some extra contrast.
