# DuoTones
Based on [DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes/) by [Simurai](http://simurai.com/)

This is a work in progress. Until now only templates for Vim and Prism have been edited.
In time the templates for SublimeText, and HighlightJs will alse be edited to tone down those brackets, punctuation and so on, in order to keep these colorschemes in the spirit of the original DuoTone Themes.

Go to [demopage](http://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/duotones)

> “DuoTone themes use only 2 hues. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.”
