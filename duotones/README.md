# DuoTones
Based on [DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes/) by [Simurai](http://simurai.com/)

This is a work in progress. When one would compare the syntax-highlighting in Atom _(with the original DuoTone colorscheme)_ in those same files in, for example Vim or Sublimetext, with the colorschemes here, then one will see that the original themes have a better considered distribution of contrast. In time the templates for Vim and SublimeText, Prism and HighlightJs will be edited to tone down those brackets, punctuation and so on, in order to keep these colorschemes in the spirit of the original DuoTone Themes.

Go to [demopage](http://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/duotones)

> “DuoTone themes use only 2 hues. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.”
