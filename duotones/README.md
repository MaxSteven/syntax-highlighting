# DuoTones
Based on [DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes/) by [Simurai](http://simurai.com/)
Go to [demopage](http://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/duotones)

> “DuoTone themes use only 2 hues. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.”

### Downloads
All downloads can be [found in the output](https://github.com/atelierbram/syntax-highlighting/tree/master/duotones/output/) folder.

NOTE: For Atom, please use [the original theme](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone) by [Simurai](https://atom.io/users/simurai).

For Sublime Text, go to the [Textmate folder](https://github.com/atelierbram/syntax-highlighting/tree/master/duotones/output/textmate) within the output folder.

TODO: This is a work in progress. When one would compare the syntax-highlighting in Atom _(with the original DuoTone colorscheme)_, with those same files with for example Vim or Sublimetext with the colorschemes here, then one will see that the original themes have a better considered distrubution of contrast. In time I am going to edit the templates for Vim and SublimeText, at least to tone down those punctuation and brackets, in order to highlight the more important ones.
