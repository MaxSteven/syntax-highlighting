# Fira Sans 

On commission of Mozilla, and on behalf of Eden Spiekermann in Berlin, from July 2012 to August 2013, [Ralph du Carois from Carrois Type Design](http://www.carrois.com/type.html) and [Erik Spiekermann](http://spiekermann.com/) designed the Fira Sans typeface ( initially called Feura Sans ).    
Fira is the new font family for Firefox OS. So far Fira includes 8 Sans Cuts - 4 uprights and 4 Italics - and 2 monos. Fira is the younger sister of Meta. ( Meta typeface, designed and developed by Erik Spiekermann in the late 1980s, which is being used as the brand typeface of the Mozilla Foundation ). Although the typeface was redrawn from scratch, it is clearly stylistically akin to Meta.
A serif version of Fira is expected to follow soon, as well as Arabic and Hebrew versions.

Firefox OS has always been a collaborative project including various partners specializing in many disciplines from engineering to UX. Leveraging the industry contacts of the experienced Telefonica Digital UX team we were able to secure a working partnership with Erik Spiekermann for the commission of the Firefox OS open sans serif typeface. Erik was involved with the development of Meta Sans, our brand typeface which is currently used in a wide variety of our brand and product wordmarks.

We chose to design a typeface that would be a close cousin to Meta Sans, to maximize on the Firefox feel however with several significant changes in its character. Meta Sans was designed in the late 80s for the Deutsche Bundespost with a focus on distinguishable glyphs, high legibility with neutral spacing due to it’s print use, primarily on low quality paper.

Fast forward nearly 25 years, media has changed (somewhat), although our display media is digital, the primarily Firefox OS devices at launch have lower pixel per inch density likely close to the print media Meta was designed for. With digital, hinting greatly alters glyph fidelity over what bleeding ink did in print, leading to shapes that need to be more direct with less complexity, especially at small sizes. When compared to Meta Sans the overall typeface is wider, has less contrast and fewer stylistic elements which allows it to render with more clarity. The x-height needed to be increased for improved legibility, and a compromise in width needed to be attained, to balance between shape distinction and word count per line. 

Other characteristics of our font include:

* Form differentiation between the glyphs of 1, l and I, the low- ercase l has a little “kick” to add a more casual feel
* Extra care was given to the “rn” combination to create a great- er distinction between the forms allowing them NOT to read like a “m”
* Looped lowercase “g”
* Lining figures have slightly smaller numbers than the upper- case characters
* The number 1 in lining figures doesn’t have a slab serif and is kerned closer to the other characters while the 1 in tabular figures does a have slab serif font so it’s much more uniform
